Simple Weather app that fetches data from a weather api and a rapper from another api based on the same geographic coordinates queried. Originally made in react I also made an extremely bare bones version in Backbone.js [here](https://github.com/heyextra/-learning-weather-rap), no pun intended! I have included this project not because it is good, as I am lightyears ahead of this now, but to serve as a reminder to myself where I started.
